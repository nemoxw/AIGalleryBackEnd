# WangXie-finalproject-backend

Team member: Wang Xie (one person project)

Iteration 1:
I have used my own MERN stack project code as the starter code. Changes have been made to the controllers, DAOs and .env starter code to be consistent with the newgallery project. 

Currently the backend is working functionally with the new frontend for the final project.

Iteration 2:

Have implemented both front and back end of the functionality of uploading an image from the client's side and then uploading the image to google cloud storage which gives a URL associated to the image, and then updating the database with the new URL. 


Iteration 3:

Implemented the backend for the rating functionalities of the reviews.
